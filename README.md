## Purpose 
This app was created by Ben Mellin for a statistics project. This project explores Minnesota Vikings individual play data over the years.
## Source 
This data is from an [nflscrapr project](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maxhorowitz/nflplaybyplay2009to2016/data). The original dataset is not included here due to size constraints.

## EDA 
Static data exploration can be found [here](https://github.com/benmellinncsu/project2/blob/main/eda.pdf).

## Data Filtering
The original data set was filtered to include only vikings data by using this file: [get_final_dset.R](https://github.com/benmellinncsu/project2/blob/main/get_final_dset.R). The modified dataset can be found [here](https://github.com/benmellinncsu/project2/blob/main/final_vikings_data.csv.zip)

## App.r deployment
The final deployment of the Shiny App can be found [here]().

## SKOL!!!
